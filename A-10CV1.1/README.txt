This is designed in KiCAD 5.0.4

Front panel included using Front Panel Designer.

Both of these applications are free.

These are as-is and are not guaranteed.

In fact this is the 1.1 revision.
A noob mistake I found was that you cannot use Digital pins 0 and 1 if you use this card on a serial 
port, as those are Transmit and Receive for the USB COM port.

I have revised the schematics and layout to move those IOs to A0 and A1 on J3.

I have also added in the connections for a NANO.

And two JST connectors for an external reset button and a Mode selector switch for A-10 and F-18.

Happy BRRRRTing!
